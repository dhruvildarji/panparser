## ðŸŽ¯ Usage Examples for Release Page

### Basic Folder Processing with Filtering
```python
from panparsex import parse_folder

# Parse folder with automatic programming file filtering
documents, summary = parse_folder("./documents", recursive=True)

print(f"Total files found: {summary.total_files_found}")
print(f"Programming files ignored: {summary.programming_files_ignored}")
print(f"Files parsed successfully: {summary.files_parsed_successfully}")
print(f"File types processed: {summary.file_types_processed}")
```

### CLI Usage
```bash
# Parse folder with automatic programming file filtering
panparsex parse ./documents --folder-mode --recursive

# Parse folder and combine into single document
panparsex parse ./documents --folder-mode --unified-output --output combined.json

# Parse with detailed summary and filtering
panparsex parse ./documents --folder-mode --extract-images --ai-process
```

### Advanced Folder Processing
```python
from panparsex import parse_folder_unified
from panparsex.ai_processor import AIProcessor

# Parse folder and combine into single document
unified_doc, summary = parse_folder_unified(
    "./documents",
    recursive=True,
    file_patterns=['*.pdf', '*.txt', '*.json'],
    exclude_patterns=['*.tmp', '.git']
)

print(f"Combined document: {len(unified_doc.sections)} sections")
print(f"Total images: {len(unified_doc.images)}")
print(f"Processing summary: {summary}")

# Process with AI
processor = AIProcessor(api_key="your-openai-key")
result = processor.process_document(
    unified_doc,
    task="Analyze all documents and create comprehensive summary",
    output_format="structured_json"
)
```

## ðŸ“Š Test Results

### Mixed File Type Test
