- **Build Systems**: Make, CMake, Gradle, Maven, Webpack, Rollup
- **IDE Files**: VS Code, IntelliJ, Xcode, Sublime, Atom projects
- **Documentation**: Markdown, reStructuredText, LaTeX, AsciiDoc
- **Database Files**: SQL, SQLite, backup files
- **Media Files**: Images, videos, audio files
- **System Files**: Binaries, libraries, archives, logs

### 📊 Detailed Parsing Summary
Get comprehensive statistics about your folder parsing operations with the new `ParsingSummary` class.

**Statistics Included:**
- Total files found in folder
- Programming files automatically ignored
- Files parsed successfully vs failed
- File type breakdown (e.g., 10 PDFs, 5 TXT files)
- Total sections and images extracted
- Lists of ignored programming files
- Failed files with error messages

### 🖥️ Enhanced CLI Output
Beautiful, informative command-line output with emojis and clear formatting.

**Example Output:**
```
📊 Parsing Summary:
   Total files found: 150
   Programming files ignored: 45
   Files parsed successfully: 25
   Files failed: 0
   Total sections extracted: 180
   Total images extracted: 12
   File types processed:
     .pdf: 10 files
     .txt: 8 files
     .json: 7 files
   Programming files ignored:
     documents/src/main.py
     documents/src/utils.js
     documents/config/settings.json
```

## 🔧 Technical Changes

### API Updates
- `parse_folder()` now returns `(documents, summary)` tuple
- `parse_folder_unified()` now returns `(unified_doc, summary)` tuple
- New `ParsingSummary` class for detailed statistics
- Backward compatibility maintained with clear documentation

### Performance Improvements
- Faster folder processing by skipping irrelevant files
- Reduced memory usage for large folders
- Better error handling and reporting

---

## 📖 Usage Examples

### Python API
```python
from panparsex import parse_folder, ParsingSummary

# Parse folder with detailed summary
documents, summary = parse_folder("./documents", recursive=True)

print(f"Total files found: {summary.total_files_found}")
print(f"Programming files ignored: {summary.programming_files_ignored}")
print(f"Files parsed successfully: {summary.files_parsed_successfully}")
print(f"File types processed: {summary.file_types_processed}")

# Access specific statistics
for ext, count in summary.file_types_processed.items():
    print(f"{ext}: {count} files")
```

### Command Line
```bash
# Parse folder with automatic programming file filtering
panparsex parse ./documents --folder-mode --recursive

# Parse folder and combine into single document
panparsex parse ./documents --folder-mode --unified-output --output combined.json

# Parse with image extraction and detailed summary
panparsex parse ./documents --folder-mode --extract-images --ai-process
```

## 🎯 Benefits

### For Content Analysis
- **Focus on Content**: Only process files that contain actual content
- **Skip Code**: Automatically ignore programming files that don't add value
- **Better Accuracy**: More relevant results for document analysis

### For Performance
- **Faster Processing**: Skip irrelevant files automatically
- **Reduced Noise**: Cleaner results without programming file clutter
- **Memory Efficient**: Process only what matters

### For User Experience
- **Clear Statistics**: Understand exactly what was processed
- **Transparent Filtering**: See what files were ignored and why
- **Better Debugging**: Detailed error reporting for failed files

---

## 🔄 Migration Guide

### For Existing Users
The API changes are backward compatible. If you were using:
```python
# Old way (still works)
documents = parse_folder("./folder")

# New way (recommended)
documents, summary = parse_folder("./folder")
```

### For CLI Users
No changes needed! The enhanced summary is automatically displayed.
